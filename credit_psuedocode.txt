Determining Validity
- Every other digit in the number (starting from the second to last digit) will be multiplied by 2
    - Of those numbers, add all of the digits together
- Then, add the digits that were not multiplied by 2 together
- Finally, add both sums together
    - If the total's last digit is 0, then the card number is valid
    - If the total's last digit is not 0, then print invalid
